# fairtear
Tears apart datasets coupled with algorithms to determine whether or not they are fair. Coupled up with [FairSquare](https://github.com/sedrews/fairsquare), which is used to determine whether a population distribution coupled with an algorithm are fair when combined. 

The goal of this project was to produce a more user-friendly interface/abstraction layer for this interesting and crucial backend.
